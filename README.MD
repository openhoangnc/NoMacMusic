Another tool designed to disable the annoying auto-play music feature on macOS.

When you connect Bluetooth headphones, sometimes macOS automatically launches the Music app and starts playing music. This tool prevents the Music app from launching.

Inspired by [noTunes](https://github.com/tombonez/noTunes), this tool is simpler and more lightweight.

By separating the launcher and the background process, this tool consumes almost no CPU and RAM resources.
